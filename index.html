            <p>My name is Pananart Techasathitwong. I am currently studying at Lincoln University, majoring in MBA,
                Management Information Systems. I am an active person who likes to explore the new experiences in life.
                Whenever I am given opportunities to learn new things, I always put all my effort in doing my best.
                Although I can be playful sometimes, I have never failed to complete my assignments on time (Try my
                best!!) as I consider work responsibility as one of the most important aspect for success in career.</p>
            <p id="clear">I like dog, especially pug dog. It is very cute dog. Even though, I like it, I am scrared that
                I can't treat them well and I have so many things to do.</p>
